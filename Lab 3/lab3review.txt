Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select *
  from products
  where city <> 'Dallas' and city <> 'New York' and priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city <> 'Dallas' 
    AND city <> 'New York'   -- this is wrong by the way
    AND priceUSD >= 1;




5. List the names of agents not in New York and not in Tokyo.

Incorrect output
- You are asked to give the names only, not everything in the table.


6. List all data for products not in Dallas or Duluth that cost US$1 or more.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.



In general: 

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
