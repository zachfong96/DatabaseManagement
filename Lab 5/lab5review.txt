Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


1. Show the cities of agents booking an order for a customer whose id is 
   'c002'. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect SQL statement
- you missed a semicolon

2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- The ORDER BY is missing


6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, along 
   with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the 
   customer has ever placed an order with that agent.

Incorrect SQL statement
- Query produced an error: a.agents?

7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

Incorrect SQL statement
- Error in: "form"



In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
